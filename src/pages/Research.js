          <h3>Research Focus</h3>
            <p>Investigated compositional Boolean calculation tasks across diverse network architectures such as MLPs, LSTMs and Transformers, also looking at out-of-distribution performance and in-context learning.</p>
            <p>Currently working on analyzing abstract equality reasoning with MLP Mixer models, in different settings such as image, and different "equality" definitions.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Achievements</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Achieved consistent performance in such tasks across widths by applying Âµp normalization in MLPs. Selected as KRANIUM research fellow over Summer 2024.</li>
              <li>Leveraged self-supervised learning approaches (e.g., SimCLR) to assess how representations that are learned through SSL impact classification accuracy. Selected as KURE research fellow over Fall 2024.</li>
              <li>Investigated methods to transform in-context knowledge in LLMs into persistent memory, enabling on-the-fly model parameter updates for continuous learning. </li>
              <li>Currently working on analyzing equality reasoning with MLP Mixer models, and formulating a formal understanding of the equality reasoning problem.</li>
              <li>Ran large-scale experiments on the Kempner High Performance Cluster.</li>
              <li>Presented in lab meetings and a poster session over the summer.</li>
