            <h3>Research Focus</h3>
            <p>Investigating compositional Boolean calculation tasks across different neural network architectures including MLPs, LSTMs, and Transformers.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Achievements</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Achieved consistent performance across widths with Âµp normalization in MLPs (KRANIUM fellow over Summer 2024)</li>
              <li>Explored self-supervised learning (SimCLR) for assessing representation quality (KURE fellow over Fall 2024)</li>
              <li>Investigating methods for transforming in-context knowledge in LLMs into persistent memory</li>
              <li>Ran large-scale experiments on the Kempner High Performance Cluster</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Research Methodology</h3>
            <p>My research involves designing controlled experiments to understand how different neural network architectures learn and represent compositional tasks. I use a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation to identify the strengths and limitations of each architecture.</p>
            
            <h3>Impact</h3>
            <p>This research contributes to our understanding of how neural networks process and represent structured information, with implications for improving the mathematical reasoning capabilities of AI systems.</p>
